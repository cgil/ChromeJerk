ChromeJerk
==========

Chrome extension to automatically up vote a given Hacker News post through an automated circle jerk. This works by creating a pool of trusted voters within your circle. Upon receiving a request to a link the extension queue's up everyone within the circle and fakes browsing through Hacker News through a series of slow up vote cycles.
